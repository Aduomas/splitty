# Meeting Feedback - Group 9

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There was no agenda posted before the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a decent amount of notes, though they seem quite short for a meeting of 45 mins. Consider writing things more concretely. For example, you mention you aim to finish the tasks from last week, but you don't concretely include the distribution in the notes. Perhaps, in future notes, consider including the task distribution and summarizing a bit less and including more details, so after the meeting it's still clear what you meant in the notes.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. However, the meeting deviated from the agenda completely, and important parts such as the stand up from last week or announcements from the TA were skipped. New topics were accomodated into the meeting, but with poor time management, with one topic taking more than half the meeting time. To reiterate the point from last week, keep in mind that you only have 45 mins a week with your TA, and some things you can discuss between yourselves whenever, whilst others, like TA announcements and updates, can only be discussed during this timeslot, so organize your future agendas and TA meetings accordingly. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was very nice and constructive. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application, with good progress made, particularly from Sunday when I ran and played around with your app. A lot more features were working since two days past, good job on that! Because of the button that was working but later commented out, and the demo running incosistenly between team members, I couldn't give an *Excellent*.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: This part of the meeting was overlooked and we didn't get to hold a stand up or discuss the action list of last week.
