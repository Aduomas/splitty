# Meeting Feedback - Group 9

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was shared with the TA sufficiently ahead of the meeting. It followed the template provided by the course and the individual points of action/discussion were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a good amount of notes. They are contain concrete agreements discussed during the meeting, but consider adding a bit more details to them to make them more understandable afterwards. There was also a task distribution in the notes, with assigned people to the tasks. Good job on that! Also, consider marking more clearly in the agenda where the agenda itself ends and where the notes start.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair tried to ensure that all the topics of the agenda were covered, with appropiate timing for each, and ensure that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. He accustomed for new topics requested to be discussed during the meeting, and tried to make sure to bring the discussion back to the main points whenever it was straying unproductively, but sometimes the discussion would derail too much. On one side it was very nice to see everyone invested in the discussion and actively participating out of their own will, but on the other, keep in mind that you only have 45 mins a week with your TA, and some things you can discuss between yourselves whenever, whilst others, like TA announcements and updates, can only be discussed during this timeslot, so organize your future agendas and TA meetings accordingly. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was constructive. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application, with progress primarly on the frontend. The progress comprised mostly of client scenes, and did not seem that substantial given the time available. You mentioned that you will work this week on connecting the client side to the server side, which I agree is the next logical step to do. Keep in mind to implement this with websockets, long-polling, and REST requests. You need to have these by the end of the project, and if you don't implement them early on, it will be harder to integrate them later and adjust your code to acommodate them.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a standup where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track.
