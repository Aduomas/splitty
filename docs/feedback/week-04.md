# Meeting Feedback - Group 9

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was shared with the TA sufficiently ahead of the meeting. It followed the template provided by the course and the individual points of action/discussion were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The previous minute taker took a good amount of notes. They are contain concrete agreements discussed during the meeting, but consider adding a bit more details to them to make them more undestanable afterwards. There was also a task distribution in the notes, with assigned people to the tasks. Good job on that!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured that all the topics of the agenda were covered, with appropiate timing for each, and ensured that everyone was involved in the meeting discussions. He also accustomed for new topics requested to be discussed during the meeting, and made sure to bring the discussion back to the main points whenever it was straying unproductively, managing the time accordingly.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting very well. Everyone was active in the meeting and engaged in productive discussions out of their own volition. The overall athmosphere was constructive. Keep it up!



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team presented the current state of the their application, with good progress made from last week, with the focus on backend. It's really good that you also already dived into integration testing and set up Mockito for it. For next week, when you're properly equipped after the JavaFX lecture, I suggest also working in the frontend such that you bring it to the same level of progress as the backend and you can connect them. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The students discussed the action list of last week, and also the plan of this week. The chairman held a standup where everybody presented what they worked on last week and made sure everybody was on track.
